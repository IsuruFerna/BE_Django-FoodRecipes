# IsuruFerna-BE_Django-FoodRecipes

It's a Food Recipe application currently developing for education purposes

### IMPORTANT!!!

make sure to import users and then categories first! after that meals!! Otherwise, meals can't make relations with categories and users, so meals will be not saved in DB

## Import fake users

`python manage.py import_users`

## Import categories data from an Open-Source API

`python manage.py import_categories`

## Import meals data from an Open-Source API

`python manage.py import_meals`

## Front-end - under development
